              SILICON VALLEY MODE - NOW AVAILABLE IN YOUR MCP SERVER
================================================================================

Make your commits sound like you work at a FAANG company instead of coding 
in your pants at 3am.

================================================================================
                           2 NEW TOOLS ADDED
================================================================================

1. fckgit_silicon_valley
   
   Commits your changes with an automatically generated FAANG-tier professional
   message that includes:
   - Enterprise buzzwords (scalability, architecture, optimization)
   - Technical rationale paragraph
   - Makes trivial changes sound important
   - Optional auto-push
   
   Usage: "Commit in Silicon Valley mode"
          "Make this commit sound professional"

2. fckgit_professionalize
   
   Transforms a casual commit message into a professional one WITHOUT committing.
   Perfect for testing what your embarrassing commits could sound like.
   
   Usage: "Professionalize this message: 'fixed the bug lol'"
          "Make this sound better: 'idk just updating stuff'"

================================================================================

No extra setup needed! If you already have MCP configured, Silicon Valley
mode is ready to use.

  - "Commit in Silicon Valley mode"
  - "Make this commit sound professional"
  - "FAANG-tier commit please"
  - "Professionalize this message: 'whatever'"

================================================================================
                           THE PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

Look, we all know most commits are just "fixed stuff" or "it works now". 
But sometimes you need to sound like you're architecting distributed systems 
at scale instead of fumbling through Stack Overflow at 2am.

Silicon Valley mode bridges the gap between:
  - What you actually did: added a print statement
  - What it should sound like: implemented comprehensive observability

Is it honest? No.
Does it work? Absolutely.
Will your manager be impressed? Definitely.

================================================================================
                              WARNING
================================================================================

Using Silicon Valley mode doesn't actually make you a better engineer. 
But it does make you LOOK like one. And in tech, perception is reality.

Your commits will sound so professional that people might actually expect 
you to know what you're doing. Use with caution.

Not responsible for any promotions you receive based on commit message quality.

================================================================================

Welcome to Silicon Valley. Where every commit is an architectural improvement
and every bug fix enhances system reliability.

MIT License - Use it to fool recruiters, impress your manager, or just make
yourself feel better about that 3am debugging session.
