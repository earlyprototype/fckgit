# fckgit

A Git client so powerful, it fucks up your workflow management just by existing.

## Installation

npm install -g fckgit
```

Or if you're feeling adventurous:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/earlyprototype/fckgit.git
cd fckgit
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
fckgit init
fckgit commit
fckgit push
```

## Features

- ⚡ Lightning-fast operations
- 🔥 Blazingly fast performance

- 🎯 Focused on what matters

## Warning

⚠️ This tool is still in early development. Use at your own risk.

**Features that might break your workflow:**

- ✅ Needlessly bloated MCP server

- ✅ Maximum speed
- ✅ Over-engineered architecture
- ✅ Too many dependencies
- ✅ Experimental features enabled by default
- ✅ Might delete your entire repository (probably won't, but maybe)
